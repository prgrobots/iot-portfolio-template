## Introduction

This assessment submission form documents the completion of Assessment A1 (Sensor Integration). Your code and project work must be completed and committed to your GitHub portfolio repository in the `/A1-Electronics-Fundamentals/` folder.

**Important:** This form is for submission evidence only. Your actual code stays on GitHub.

---

## Submission Instructions

### Assessment Overview

Build an IoT device with environmental monitoring using the following sensors:
- **DHT11** temperature/humidity sensor
- **MQ-2** gas/smoke sensor
- **Flame sensor** for fire detection
- Serial output with sensor readings and threshold detection logic

### How to Complete This Assessment

1. Complete all sensor code in your `/A1-Electronics-Fundamentals/code/esp32-arduino/` folder
2. Test sensors on breadboard or Wokwi simulation
3. Commit all files to GitHub
4. Fill out this form with your submission details
5. Copy completed form into Blackboard by the due date

### What to Submit on GitHub

- ✅ Arduino `.ino` file with DHT11, MQ-2, and flame sensor code
- ✅ README.md describing sensors, pins, and threshold logic
- ✅ Wokwi simulation link OR breadboard photo
